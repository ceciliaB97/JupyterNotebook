# JupyterNotebook
This is the versioning of the my Jupyter notebook used for various types of data analysis, exploration, integration, cleansing, clustering and more.
## Contents
First you start with exploratory data analysis, so this notebook is highly recommended to look at: [Exploratory_data_Analysis.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Exploratory_data_Analysis.ipynb)

For data integration / cleansing at a smaller scale, the Python library “pandas” is often used. Please take a look at this notebook: [data-cleaning-with-python-using-pandas-library](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-with-python-using-pandas-library-c6f4a68ea8eb)

If you want to already experience what clustering is, have a look at this: [tutorial_gkbionics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/temporaer/tutorial_ml_gkbionics/blob/master/2%20-%20KMeans.ipynb)

And finally, if you want to go for a more in-depth notebook on the “iris” data set, have a look here: [iris-dataset-exploratory-data-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/lalitharajesh/iris-dataset-exploratory-data-analysis)
